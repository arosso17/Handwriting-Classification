# Handwriting-Classification

This project started as a tensorflow tutorial using the mnist digit dataset.
After completing that, I decided to add a visual interface using pygame where you can draw digits for the model to classify.

I then extended the project by adding an interface to draw letters of the alphabet to create a dataset to train new models with.
